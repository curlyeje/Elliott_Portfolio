The Monthly KPI Dashboard was created using Tableau. A Manager in the Call Center wanted a Monthly KPI Dashboard in order to 
track how his employees are doing as well as some overall information about the calls. 

Data Cleaning Steps: 

-- In the date column, the datatype was changed from String to Date.
-- Created an Hour of Call column in order to track which hours of the day we were getting the most calls. 
-- Created an average duration (seconds) column to track how long each agent was on the call with customers. 


Exploratory Data Analysis: 

-- A Satisfaction Rating (Sheet 1) was created in order to showcase our highest ratings (0-5) which were 3,4, and 5. 
We had the highest satisfaction rating with 3 being 392 customers who gave us this rating. 
-- Call Volume During Week (Sheet 2) was created to better understand which days of the week we were receiving highest amount of 
calls which were Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. These 3 days being above average on the most recent month. 
-- Call Volume During Day (Sheet 3) showed further insigts on what our busiest times were in the most recent month. 
Which were 10am, 1pm, 3pm, 4pm, and 5pm. 
-- Resolution Rate (Sheet 4) was created in order to understand what our percentages were on resolved calls for the current month. 
-- Calls Per Day (Sheet 5) was created in order to provide further insights on how many calls we received today, and 
how long the calls took on average. 
-- Resolution Rates by Agent (Sheet 6) shows Dan, Diane, and Joe being at the lowest percentile for Resolution Rates.  
-- Resolved Calls by Agent (Sheet 7) shows Dan and Joe being the lowest in Resolved Calls. 
-- Speed of Answer by Agent (Sheet 8) shows Greg, Joe, and Martha being the highest in the speed of answer. 

-- Built a Dashboard to showcase and visualize to the manager.
