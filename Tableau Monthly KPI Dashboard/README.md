The Monthly KPI Dashboard was developed using Tableau to help a Call Center Manager monitor employee performance and gain key insights into call center activity on a monthly basis.

Data Preparation:

1. Converted the Date column from string to date format for accurate time-based analysis.
2. Created a new Hour of Call column to identify peak call times throughout the day.
3. Calculated an Average Duration (in seconds) column to track how long agents were on calls with customers.

Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualizations:

Satisfaction Rating (Sheet 1): Displayed customer satisfaction ratings (scale of 0â€“5). The most common ratings were 3, 4, and 5, with rating 3 being the most frequent (392 responses).
