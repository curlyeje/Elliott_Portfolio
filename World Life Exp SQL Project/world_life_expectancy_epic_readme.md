# World Life Expectancy Project (2007â€“2022) (with Epic Context)

This project, titled **"World Life Expectancy Project"**, was completed in **MySQL Workbench** and visualized in **Tableau**. The dataset provides information on **life expectancy across different countries** from 2007 to 2022, with factors such as **BMI, diseases, adult mortality, GDP, and development status** playing a critical role in shaping global health outcomes.

Life expectancy is a key metric for understanding a country's overall health, quality of life, and socio-economic development. This analysis provides insight into global patterns, disparities between developing and developed countries, and trends over the past 15 years.

> **Epic context:** While this dataset is global and non-EHR based, in an Epic reporting environment, life expectancy analysis would map to patient-level survival metrics (derived from **PATIENT**, **PAT_ENC**, **DEATH_INFO** tables in Clarity). Public healthâ€“style insights often leverage **Caboodle population health models** or integration with registries through **Epic Healthy Planet**.

> **Epic context:** In Epic, Tableau/Power BI can be connected to **Clarity** or **Caboodle** for visualizing population health KPIs. Life expectancy at a cohort level could be calculated by integrating **death records (DEATH_INFO)** with **first encounter dates** to model survival curves.

## Data Cleaning Process

To ensure accuracy and reliability, the dataset underwent multiple data cleaning steps:

1. **Duplicate Checks**
   - Used the `ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY ...)` window function along with `CONCAT(country, year)` to identify duplicates.
   - Found and resolved **3 duplicate records**.

2. **Handling Missing Data**
   - Investigated blank values in critical columns such as **Status**, **Life Expectancy**, and **Country**.
   - Applied logical imputation where possible.

3. **Status Column Adjustment**
   - To resolve missing values in the *Status* field (Developed vs. Developing), a **self-JOIN** on the table was performed to correctly classify countries.

> **Epic context:** In Clarity, similar cleaning processes arenâ€™t typically needed, but analysts often **deduplicate patient data** across MRNs using Enterprise IDs, impute missing values via **Caboodle semantic layers**, and adjust categorical values using **ZC_* (lookup) tables**.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Findings

The cleaned dataset was analyzed to extract meaningful insights about life expectancy across nations. Key findings include:

### 1. Trends in Life Expectancy
- Over the last **15 years**, the **world's average life expectancy increased by 6 years** (2007 â†’ 2022).
- Some countries showed dramatic improvements; for example, **Haiti, Zimbabwe, and Eritrea** experienced increases of **20+ years** in life expectancy.

> **Epic context:** In Epic, life expectancy trends are approximated via **Healthy Planet population health registries** or survival analysis built on patient encounters and death dates. Clarity extracts from `PAT_ENC` and `DEATH_INFO` can be used to trend mortality across cohorts.

---

### 2. Economic Correlations
- Countries with **lower GDP** generally had **lower life expectancy**.
- Countries with **higher GDP** showed significantly **higher life expectancy**.
- On average:  
  - **High GDP countries** â†’ Life expectancy ~ **74 years**  
  - **Low GDP countries** â†’ Life expectancy ~ **65 years**

<img width="1850" height="1048" alt="Average Life Expectancy by GDP" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64a307d9-dab6-4388-a8f6-77a1ed2ddd83" />

> **Epic context:** Within a health system, **payer/financial class** (from `COVERAGE`, `PAYOR_PLAN`) often correlates with utilization and outcomes, similar to GDP effects at the national level. Epic analysts frequently build dashboards comparing **life expectancy gaps by socioeconomic status**.

---

### 3. Development Status Insights
- The dataset revealed **developing countries lagging** behind developed countries in life expectancy.
- Average values showed **66.83 years** for developing vs. **79.20 years** for developed nations.

<img width="1068" height="1106" alt="Average Life Expectancy by Development Status" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15a61259-7de3-4d7e-b3a8-41e020413027" />

> **Epic context:** Epicâ€™s **Healthy Planet registries** often stratify outcomes by development-like categories, but within the U.S. context, that translates to **Medicaid vs. Commercial vs. Medicare** payer groups or **social determinants of health (SDOH)** captured in `SDOH_*` tables.

---

### 4. Impact of Health Factors
- **BMI (Body Mass Index)** showed noticeable correlation patterns when compared to life expectancy.  
- **Adult Mortality** provided deeper insights into national health systems and challenges.  
  - Example: The **United States of America** reported a **rolling total of 931 adult mortalities** from 2007â€“2022.

<img width="2006" height="1050" alt="Life Expectancy vs Adult Mortality and BMI" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c64fbd7-32e9-473b-8f9b-10cf5352d3b1" />

> **Epic context:**  
> - BMI comes from Epic flowsheets (**FLO_MEAS** table) or vitals in `VITALS`.  
> - Adult mortality aligns to `DEATH_INFO` and survival calculations across `PAT_ENC`.  
> - Public health comparisons (like here) mirror Epicâ€™s **population health dashboards** that track chronic disease prevalence, obesity, and mortality.

---

## Key Insights

- Life expectancy is **steadily improving worldwide**, but disparities remain between developing and developed nations.  
- **GDP is a strong predictor** of a country's average life expectancy.  
- Countries with weaker health systems still face challenges related to **adult mortality, BMI, and disease prevalence**.  
- Global health efforts have contributed to improved outcomes, but **systemic inequalities** remain a critical issue.  

> **Epic context:** Health systems using Epic can perform similar **disparity analyses** at the patient levelâ€”stratifying survival and quality-of-care outcomes by race, payer, or socioeconomic indicators in Clarity or Caboodle.
