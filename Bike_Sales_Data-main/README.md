# Bike_Sales_Data

I was able to complete this project using Microsoft Excel. The project topic was on Regional Bike Sales,and how many people purchased or did not purchase bikes. The questions that needed to be ansewered are as follows:

What Gender purchased the most bikes with respect to their average income?
How many people purchased bikes with respect to their daily commute?
What age bracket purchased the most bikes?
The first stage was the Data Cleaning Stage. The Data Cleaning Stage involved removing duplicates, standardizing the data, removing NULL or Blank values if necessary, and removing unnecessary columns. The second stage was creating a pivot table that dissected the three questions that needed to be solved. A dashboard was created to further then investigate the data by utlizing slicers to filter out the data with respect to Marital Status, Region, and Education. This was an additive just in case stakeholders wanted to filter out some of these domains in the near future. Here is what I found very interesting when answering these questions.

Males purchased the most bikes with respect to their average income.
From 0-1 miles, 200 people purchased bikes.
There were 383 Middle Aged Adults that purchased the most bikes.
