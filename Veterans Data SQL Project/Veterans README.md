## 📌 Project Overview  
This project was developed in **Tableau** to analyze patterns in veterans’ healthcare data, including emergency department (ED) visits, inpatient discharges, and behavioral health trends. The goal was to identify critical insights that can inform better resource allocation and improve care strategies for veterans.  

---

## 📊 Data Preparation  
- Data was cleaned, transformed, and structured for analysis in Tableau.  
- Key dimensions included **patient demographics, encounter types, diagnoses, and time periods**.  
- Measures included **encounter volumes, percentages, and trend comparisons** across years.

## 📈 Visualizations & Insights  

### 1. Substance Use Disorders  
- **Insight:** Substance use disorders accounted for **6.36%** of all veteran cases, highlighting an area for potential intervention.  

---

### 2. Emergency Department vs. Inpatient Visits (2020–2022)  
- **Finding:** ED visits were significantly higher, totaling **166,052,508**, compared to inpatient visits.  
- This reflects a heavier reliance on emergency services among veterans.  

---

### 3. Discharges by Demographic Category  
- **Observation:** "All Discharges" represented the **largest demographic category value** from 2020–2022, providing a macro-level view of care utilization.  

---

## 🏥 Final Dashboard  
All key insights were compiled into an **interactive Tableau dashboard**, allowing users to explore patterns in utilization, diagnoses, and demographic trends.  

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways  
- Substance use disorders remain a **notable challenge** in veteran healthcare.  
- Veterans rely heavily on **emergency department services** compared to inpatient care.  
- Discharge patterns highlight opportunities for **targeted support and intervention**.
