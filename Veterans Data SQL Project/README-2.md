# Veterans Who Used VA Health Care (2010--2015)

This dataset titled **"Veterans Who Used VA Health Care"** provides
annual data from 2010 to 2015 on the utilization of VA health services
across all U.S. states.

Each record includes: - State name\
- Total veteran population\
- Number of veterans who used VA health care\
- Percentage of veterans utilizing these services

On average, about **27.6% of veterans** in each state used VA health
care annually, though this rate varied widely---from as low as **16%**
to as high as **54.5%**. The data shows significant differences in both
veteran population sizes and VA usage across states, with larger states
like **California** or **Texas** showing higher numbers of VA patients.

The dataset offers valuable insight into trends in health care access
and utilization among veterans over time, highlighting regional and
temporal variations that could inform policy or program development.

Several SQL transformations were applied, including renaming columns for
readability, converting data types, rounding percentages, and removing
inconsistent records. Validation checks ensured accuracy in percentage
calculations.
