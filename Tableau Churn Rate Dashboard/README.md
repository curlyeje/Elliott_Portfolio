This project was completed using Tableau for a telemarketing company seeking insights into high customer churn rates. Fortunately, the dataset required no cleaning, as it contained no duplicates or inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Tenure Churn Count: Highlighted churn distribution based on customer tenure, showing that newer customers were more likely to churn.
