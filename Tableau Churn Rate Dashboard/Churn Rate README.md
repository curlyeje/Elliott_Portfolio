This project was developed in **Tableau** to help a telemarketing company understand and reduce **customer churn rates**. The dashboard provides actionable insights by analyzing key factors that influence churn, such as tenure, contract type, payment method, and monthly charges.

The dataset required **no cleaning**, as it contained no duplicates or inconsistencies, allowing for a focused exploratory data analysis (EDA).
