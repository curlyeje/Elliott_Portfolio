## Project Overview
This project was built in **Tableau** to help evaluate investment opportunities in the **Seattle, Washington Airbnb market**.  
The clientâ€™s goal was to determine whether purchasing a **3-bedroom home** would be a profitable strategy for short-term rentals. Using a dataset dating back to **2016**, I developed a series of visualizations to uncover pricing trends, seasonality, and market competitiveness.

## Data Preparation
I worked with three main tables:  
- **Listings**  
- **Calendar**  
- **Reviews** (excluded from analysis since customer feedback was not a key decision factor)  

A **JOIN operation** was performed to combine the **Listings** and **Calendar** tables using their primary key. This enriched the dataset with both property details and calendar availability, enabling deeper insights.
