This project was completed using Tableau to create compelling visualizations aimed at helping my friend make an informed investment in an Airbnb property. He was specifically interested in purchasing a 3-bedroom home in the Seattle, Washington area to rent out via Airbnb. The dataset, which dates back to 2016, was imported into Tableau and analyzed using multiple data sources.

Data Overview
I worked with three primary tables: Listings, Calendar, and Reviews.

A JOIN operation was used to combine the Listings and Calendar tables via their primary key to enrich the data for deeper analysis.
The Reviews table was excluded from the analysis, as customer reviews were not a priority for my friend's decision-making.
