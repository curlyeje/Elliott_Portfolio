# United States National Debt Analysis (Excel Project)

## Project Overview
This project was completed using **Microsoft Excel** to analyze and visualize trends in the **United States national debt** over time. The objective was to transform raw, unstructured financial data into meaningful insights by leveraging Excelâ€™s advanced functionalities, including pivot tables, forecasting functions, and data visualization tools.  

The analysis highlights both historical patterns and projected future trends in national debt, enabling a clear understanding of fiscal changes over the years.

## Data Preparation
The raw dataset required extensive preparation to ensure accuracy and usability:  

- **Transposed Data:** Rows and columns were adjusted to properly align the dataset for meaningful analysis.  
- **Standardized Number Formats:** Figures initially displayed in scientific notation were reformatted into standard numerical values for clarity and precision.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Several analyses were conducted after the data cleaning process:  

1. **Yearly Percentage Change**  
   - Calculated the annual percentage increase in national debt to measure fiscal growth rates.
