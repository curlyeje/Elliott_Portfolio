This project was completed using Microsoft Excel to analyze and visualize trends in the United States national debt over time.

Data Preparation:
The raw dataset required several cleaning steps to ensure accuracy and usability:

Raw Data Screenshot: 

Transposed the data to align rows and columns correctly for analysis.
Converted scientific notation into standard number formats to accurately reflect the figures in each column.
Analysis Steps:
Once the data was cleaned, I performed the following analyses:

Calculated the Yearly Percentage Change in national debt.
Created Monthly Historical Trends using Pivot Tables.
Used the FORECAST function to project future debt trends.
Key Findings:
The average annual increase in debt between 2016 and 2019 was approximately 5%.
A significant spike in national debt aligns with the COVID-19 pandemic response measures in the U.S.
The highest monthly increases typically occurred in January, February, November, and December.
The lowest increases were seen during April, May, June, and July.
Publicly held debt is projected to continue increasing at a steady rate in the near future.
