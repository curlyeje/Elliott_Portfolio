The US Debt Tracker project was completed using Microsoft Excel. 

The data first had go through the cleaning phase which consisted of:

-- Transposing The Data so that the columns and rows lined up. 
-- The numbers were in scientific notations, so changed it to numbers to help it make sense with respect to each column. 

Once the data was cleaned, then I moved on to: 

-- Looking at the Yearly Percentage Change, Monthly Historicals by creating a pivot table, and the projected growth using the 
forecast function. 

The Final Outputs shows us: 

-- The average increase was around 5% in the previous years of 2016-2019. 
-- There was a large spike that was most likely caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic responses in the USA. 
-- Highest debt increases were during the months of January, February, November, and December. 
-- Lowest debt increases were during the months of April, May, June, and July. 
-- Publicly held debt is projected to increase at a stady rate.
