# Bike_Sales_Data

The dataset is designed to help analyze customer demographics and behaviors to understand who is likely to purchase a bicycle. It is likely used for predictive modeling, segmentation, or business decision-making in a retail or marketing context.

I successfully completed this project using Microsoft Excel, focusing on Regional Bike Sales and analyzing patterns among individuals who purchased or did not purchase bicycles. The goal was to answer key business questions related to customer demographics and purchasing behavior:

Which gender purchased the most bikes, and how does this relate to their average income?
How does daily commute distance affect the likelihood of purchasing a bike?
Which age bracket had the highest number of bike purchases?
The project was carried out in multiple stages:

Data Cleaning:

- Removing Duplicates: In this dataset, there were not any duplicates.

- Standardizing Data:

1. Changed the Gender and Marital Status Columns to make it look more appealing for vizualtion.

2. Added an Age Bracket Column in order to filter on it when building the dashboard.

Data Analysis & Pivot Table Creation:
In the second stage, I built a pivot table to explore and break down the three central questions. This helped in identifying clear trends and comparisons across demographic groups.

Dashboard Design:
To enhance interactivity and insight delivery, I created a dashboard using slicers that allow filtering the data by Marital Status, Region, and Education Level. This feature was added with stakeholders in mind, allowing them to explore specific segments of interest dynamically.

Key Findings:
Males were the leading purchasers of bikes, especially among those with higher average incomes.
Among those with a 0â€“1 mile commute, 200 individuals purchased bikes.
The Middle-Aged Adult group had the highest number of buyers, with 383 purchases recorded.
