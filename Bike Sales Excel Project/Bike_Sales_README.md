# Bike Sales Excel Project

This project analyzes **customer demographics and behaviors** to better understand factors influencing bicycle purchases. The dataset is intended for use in **predictive modeling, segmentation, and retail decision-making**.  

I completed this project using **Microsoft Excel**, focusing on **Regional Bike Sales** and identifying purchasing patterns among individuals who did or did not purchase bicycles. The analysis sought to answer three key business questions:  

1. Which gender purchased the most bikes, and how does this relate to their average income?  
2. How does daily commute distance affect the likelihood of purchasing a bike?  
3. Which age bracket had the highest number of bike purchases?

## 🧹 Data Cleaning  

The dataset required light preparation to improve readability and usability for analysis.  

- **Removed duplicates** → none were found.  
- **Standardized categorical data** → reformatted columns such as `Gender` and `Marital Status` for clearer visualization.  
- **Created an Age Bracket column** using Excel’s `IF` function to group customers into categories (e.g., Adolescents, Middle-Aged Adults).

## 📊 Data Analysis & Pivot Tables  

Pivot tables were used to explore and visualize relationships across demographic and behavioral variables.

## 📊 Dashboard Design  

To improve accessibility and interactivity, a dashboard was created using Excel slicers. This allowed stakeholders to filter results by **Marital Status, Region, and Education Level**, giving them flexibility to explore customer segments.
