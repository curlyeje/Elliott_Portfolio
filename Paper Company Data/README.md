This project was developed using Tableau and focused on analyzing data from a paper supply company. The objective was to provide the manager with deeper insights into product performance and trends across different customer segments. A comprehensive dashboard and story presentation were created to effectively communicate findings to the manager and other stakeholders.

Data Cleaning:
No duplicate records or standardization issues were found in either of the datasets.
A relationship was established between the orders and order_details tables to ensure accurate analysis and answer the manager’s core questions.
