This project was completed using Tableau. The project consisted of paper company data in which the manager wanted further insigts on how our current products in the company are performing. A dashboard was built and generated a story to share with the manager and other stakeholders. 

Data Cleaning Steps: 

-- There weren't any duplicates in the data nor any data that neeeded standardization in both tables. 
-- Created a Relationship between the orders and order_details tables in order to solve the manager's question. 



Exploratory Data Analysis: 

-- In the Profitability of Products Story, (1st slide) I found that the current products in the Office Accessories and Organization section sells more products than any other category. 

-- On the 2nd slide, I took a deeper dive into the priniting and technology category and found that profit increased 64.5% in 4 years while other categories have remained stagnant. 

-- On the 3rd slide, it was found that the highest profit product in our Printing and Technology Category was the Graphing Calculator which were 43% of total profit over the last 4 years. 

-- On the final slide, there is a Map and Segmentation of customers who purchased the graphing calculator and whether they were individual consumers, small businesses, or corporations. The Map of Calculator Sales for Individual Consumers gives the manager an indepth view of customers who purchased the Graphing Calculator around the U.S.
