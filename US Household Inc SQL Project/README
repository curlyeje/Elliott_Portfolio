This project was completed usting MYSQL Workbench. The dataset consisted of the US Household Income and varied by State, City,
and Types. There was another table that was INNER JOINED in order to calculate the Mean and Median to know which States, City, 
and Types are doing well. The Statistics table did not go through the data cleaning process as there was nothing to clean. 

Data Cleaning Steps: 

-- Removed Duplicates by using the window function ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY) in order to partition on the duplicate ID's 
which were the primary key in order to identify the duplicates in this dataset. 
-- Removed any unnecessary duplicates


Standardizing Data: 

-- Noticed that the State_Name column had some grammatical and capitalization errors. Used the UPDATE clause. 
-- Checked for blank values and updated it with the correct correct county and city. 
-- Worked on the Type column in order to identify possible types that are the same. 
-- Check for Awater and ALand columns to identify if it was 0 or NULL values.
