This project was completed using MySQL Workbench, with the dataset focusing on U.S. Household Income, segmented by State, City, 
and Income Type. An additional table "statistics" was INNER JOINED to calculate Mean and Median values, allowing for comparison across different regions 
and income categories to determine which areas are performing well.

Data Cleaning Steps: 

1. The Statistics table did not require any data cleaning, as it was already well-structured.

2. The main table needed some cleaning. 

- Identified and removed duplicate records using the ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY ...) window function, focusing on the ID column, 
which served as the primary key.

- Eliminated any unnecessary or redundant duplicates.


Exploratory Data Analysis: 

- Corrected grammatical and capitalization issues in the State_Name column using the UPDATE statement.

- Addressed missing values by populating them with the correct county and city names.

- Standardized the Type column by reviewing and consolidating inconsistent naming conventions.
Inspected the ALand (Land Area) and AWater (Water Area) columns for 0 or NULL values to ensure completeness and accuracy.
