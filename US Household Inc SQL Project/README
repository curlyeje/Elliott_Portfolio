This project was completed usting MYSQL Workbench. 

Data Cleaning Steps: 

-- Removed Duplicates by using the window function ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY) in order to partition on the duplicate ID's 
which were the primary key in order to identify the duplicates in this dataset. 
-- Removed any unnecessary duplicates


Standardizing Data: 

-- Noticed that the State_Name column had some grammatical and capitalization errors. Used the UPDATE clause. 
-- Checked for blank values and updated it with the correct correct county and city. 
-- Worked on the Type column in order to identify possible types that are the same. 
-- Check for Awater and ALand columns to identify if it was 0 or NULL values.
