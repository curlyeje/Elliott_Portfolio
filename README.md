This project was developed in **Tableau** to provide actionable insights for a friend considering an Airbnb investment.  
The focus was on purchasing a **3-bedroom home in Seattle, WA** for short-term rental.  

The dataset (dating back to **2016**) was analyzed using multiple data sources to evaluate property pricing, seasonal trends, and market demand.

## ðŸ“‚ Data Overview
The analysis utilized three main tables:

- **Listings** â€“ property details (bedrooms, location, etc.)  
- **Calendar** â€“ availability and pricing over time  
- **Reviews** â€“ excluded from the analysis, as customer sentiment was not a priority  

A **JOIN** operation was performed between *Listings* and *Calendar* to enrich the dataset.
